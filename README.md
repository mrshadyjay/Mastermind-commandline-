# Mastermind-commandline-
This is a command line version of the mastermind game I made 2025

There are 3 main modes
The single player mode- Where the users play against the computer; it generates a random code of colours and you have to guess within ten tries

The two player mode- The second player makes the random code and the other player guesses

The campaign mode- This mode has increasing difficulty for the single player
