WELCOME TO MASTERMIND

────────────────────────────────────────────
GENERAL HOW-TO

The general aim of Mastermind is to guess the correct colour code (both colour and position) that is secretly chosen by the opponent. You have a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the secret code.

Each code is made up of 4 colours. The possible colours used are:
[R] = Red
[O] = Orange
[Y] = Yellow
[G] = Green
[B] = Blue

Colours can repeat in the code, and the order is important.

After each guess, you'll receive feedback:
✓ (Check mark) → Correct colour in the correct position (Black peg)
○ (Circle)     → Correct colour in the wrong position (White peg)

Example:
Secret Code: R O G B  
Your Guess:  R G B P  
Feedback: ✓ Black peg(s): 1, ○ White peg(s): 2
Explanation: R, G and B are secret code but only R is in the right place, that's why you got one tick and two circles.

SINGLE-PLAYER MODE

In this mode, you will play against the computer.

- The computer randomly generates a secret code.
- Your task is to guess the 4-colour code within 10 tries.
- After each guess, the computer gives you feedback using the ✓ and ○.
- Guess correctly within 10 attempts to win!
- If you fail, the computer reveals the secret code.

How to start:
Select “Single-Player” from the menu.

────────────────────────────────────────────
TWO-PLAYER MODE

In this mode, two human players play against each other.

- Player 1 sets a secret 4-colour code.
- Player 2 attempts to guess the code within 10 tries.
- After each guess, the computer will provide feedback on player 2's pick.
- After 10 attempts, the game reveals the code if Player 2 hasn’t guessed correctly.

Rules:
- Keep the code secret!
- Switch turns, to see who is better at guessing secret codes :)

────────────────────────────────────────────
CAMPAIGN MODE

Campaign Mode includes a sequence of increasingly difficult challenges.

- Each level features a new code with varying complexity.
- The number of available colours might increase as you progress.
- Later stages may include 5- or 6-length codes


────────────────────────────────────────────
TIPS

- Start with a guess that uses different colours to gather more information.
- Pay close attention to which colours get ✓ and ○ feedback.
- Track your guesses and feedback to narrow down the possibilities.
- Be strategic—random guessing will cost you your 10 chances quickly.
